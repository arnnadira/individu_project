                    <h1 class="headings">Diploma</h1>
                    <p>I started my diploma era at the end of 2021 which is October 2021.
                        I continued my diploma at UiTM Kelantan campus Machang.I majored in business 
                        as a course during my diploma. During my diploma I joined KESATRIA as an 
                        extracurricular and every Sunday we have activities that have been set by 
                        this extracurricular. I have also participated in some activities organized 
                        by UiTM such as color run. I enjoyed being in my diploma era.</p>

                    <h1 class="headings">Degree</h1>
                    <p>I began my degree period in March 2023, which is the beginning of 2023. At the Kota 
                        Bharu campus of UiTM Kelantan, I pursued my degree further.During my degree program, 
                        I took courses leading up to my major in marketing. I took part in some UiTM-organized 
                        events during my degree, such futsal. I competed in futsal on behalf of my faculty in 
                        the Sukan Antara Fakulti (SAF), but we were only able to advance to the quarterfinals.
                        I'm still content though, because I made a lot of new friends there.</p>
